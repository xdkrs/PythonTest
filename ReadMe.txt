!----------------------------------- Python Test Read-me file -----------------------------------!
This Repository contains two .py files, used to manipulate an internal excel file and save the extraction in a new excel file named final.
The first file(main1.py) contains a type of extraction which is used here, except the criteria regarding the 'Danger' and 'Warning' keywords, will place the 'Description 1' value in two separate columns and in the first column the product code.
The second file(main2.py) will use the same criteria, but will store the data in separated sheets and will extract both 'Description 1' and 'Description 2' values.

The assets, are saved the same way in both cases.
